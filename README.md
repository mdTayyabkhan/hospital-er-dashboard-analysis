# HOSPITAL-ER-DASHBOARD-ANALYSIS

A comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) project designed to analyze and visualize Emergency Room (ER) data to uncover trends in **patient wait times**, **satisfaction levels**, **departmental referrals**, **admission patterns**, and **demographics**. Built using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, this interactive dashboard empowers healthcare stakeholders to optimize ER operations, improve patient care, and make data-driven decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

* Analyze **patient flow** and **admission rates** in the ER.
* Evaluate **wait times** and their impact on **patient satisfaction**.
* Identify **peak hours and busy days** for efficient resource planning.
* Assess **departmental referral rates** to determine workload and demand.
* Examine **demographic patterns** by age, gender, and race.
* Provide actionable insights through interactive and visually compelling reports.

## 📊 Key Dashboard Features

### ⏳ **Wait Time & Satisfaction Analysis**

* Visual correlation between **average wait time** and **satisfaction scores**.
* Highlights areas where delays negatively impact patient experience.
* Identifies opportunities to enhance service delivery.

### 🏥 **Departmental Referrals**

* Tracks the number of patients referred to each department (e.g., Orthopedics, Cardiology).
* Pinpoints departments under high ER referral loads.
* Helps in resource reallocation and workforce planning.

### 📅 **Peak Period Identification**

* Time-based analysis reveals **daily and hourly patterns** of ER visits.
* Highlights busiest hours (10 AM–2 PM, 6 PM–9 PM) and high-volume days (e.g., Mondays, weekends).
* Assists in optimizing staff schedules and triage processes.

### 👥 **Patient Demographics**

* Breakdown by **age group**, **gender**, and **race**.
* Useful for targeted healthcare policies and inclusive service planning.
* Reveals which population segments use ER services most frequently.

### 🧬 **Race & Equity Insights**

* Analysis of race-based distributions in wait times, referrals, and satisfaction.
* Identifies potential disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.
* Supports data-driven decisions for inclusive service delivery.

### 📈 **Admission Patterns**

* Distinguishes between ER patients who were **admitted** vs **discharged**.
* Analyzes departmental admission rates to evaluate critical case loads.
* Links admission outcomes with wait time and satisfaction metrics.
